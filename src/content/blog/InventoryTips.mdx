# 5 Tips for Smarter Inventory Management

Inventory is cash sitting on a shelf. If you have too much, you lose liquidity. If you have too little, you lose sales. Finding the balance is an art.

Categorize your products into three groups:
*   **A Items:** High value, low volume (e.g., Laptops). watch these closely.
*   **B Items:** Moderate value and volume.
*   **C Items:** Low value, high volume (e.g., Cables, Screws).

Safety stock is your emergency buffer. Calculate it by analyzing your lead time (how long a supplier takes) vs. your daily sales.
*Formula:* `(Max Daily Sales x Max Lead Time) - (Avg Daily Sales x Avg Lead Time)`

Don't wait once a year to count everything. Count a small section of your store every week. This is called "Cycle Counting". It keeps your database accurate without shutting down operations.

Especially for perishables (or tech that gets outdated), always sell the oldest stock first. Organize your shelves so new stock goes to the back.

Stop using paper. A good POS system (like CeroCloud!) tracks every sale and adjusts stock automatically, generating reports that tell you exactly what to reorder.
