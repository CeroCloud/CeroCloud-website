# Why Local-First Software is the Future

In a world obsessed with "The Cloud", we often forget the benefits of keeping things simple and local. At CeroCloud, we believe that for many small businesses, **Local-First** software is superior. Here is why.

## <Zap className="inline-block w-6 h-6 mr-2 text-primary" /> 1. Unmatched Speed
Cloud apps depend on your internet connection. Every click travels to a server and back. 
Local software runs directly on your device's processor. The result? **Instant response times**. Scanning a barcode adds the item immediately, with zero latency.

When you use a Cloud POS, your sales data lives on someone else's computer. They can analyze it, sell it, or lose it in a breach.
With CeroCloud, your database file (`.sqlite`) sits on your hard drive. You can encrypt it, back it up to a USB, or copy it to another PC. **You are in control.**

Internet outages happen. If your Cloud POS goes down during a rush hour, you lose money.
Local software **always works**. You can keep selling, printing receipts, and managing inventory even if your ISP is down.

## Conclusion
The Cloud is great for Netflix, but for your critical business operations, **reliability and speed come first**.
